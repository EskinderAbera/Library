# Library
This is the introduction to my free full stack web development. In this course I will be creating a library application called Mylibrary. This application will run on Django and SQLite. During this application you will learn how the backend works. How to create your own backend. How to deploy a web application. And, how to style a professional looking website. By the end of this course you will have a complete understanding of the backend of a website and be able to create your own web applications.
